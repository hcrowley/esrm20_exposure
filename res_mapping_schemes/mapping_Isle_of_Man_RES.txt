The exposure model for Isle of Man is taken from GED4GEM (see https://platform.openquake.org/exposure/) and uses the PAGER mapping scheme (https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2008/1160/downloads/PAGER_database/PAGER_Inventory_database_v2.0.xls). 

The PAGER building classes were then mapped to the GEM taxonomy as follows:

C3	CR/LFINF+CDL/HBET:3-5
UFB3	MUR+CL/LWAL+CDN/HBET:1-3
UFB4	MUR+CL/LWAL+CDN/HBET:1-3
