The exposure model for Andorra is taken from GED4GEM (see https://platform.openquake.org/exposure/) and uses the PAGER mapping scheme (https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2008/1160/downloads/PAGER_database/PAGER_Inventory_database_v2.0.xls). 

The PAGER building classes were then mapped to the GEM taxonomy as follows:

PAGER	GEM TAXONOMY
C1: 	CR/LFM+DUC/HBET:3-5
RM1:	MR/LWAL+DUL/H:2
RM2: 	MR/LWAL+DUL/H:2
S3:	S/LFM+DUL/H:1
S4: 	S/LWAL+DUL/H:1
W: 	W/LFM+DUL/H:1
