The exposure model for Andorra is taken from GED4GEM (see https://platform.openquake.org/exposure/) and uses the PAGER mapping scheme (https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2008/1160/downloads/PAGER_database/PAGER_Inventory_database_v2.0.xls). 

The PAGER building classes were then mapped to the ESRM20 taxonomy as follows:

PAGER	GEM TAXONOMY
C1: 	50% CR/LFINF+CDN/HBET:3-5 / 50% CR/LFINF+CDL/HBET:3-5
RM1:	MR/LWAL+CDL/H:2
RM2: 	MR/LWAL+CDL/H:2
S3:	S/LFM+CDL/H:1
S4: 	S/LWAL+CDL/H:1
W: 	W/LFM+CDL/H:1
