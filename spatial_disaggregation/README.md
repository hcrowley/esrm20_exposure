# Spatial Disaggregation Data

The 'ghs_global_250m_Europe.rar' file is the 250 x 250 m resolution built-up area density map released by Pesaresi et al. (2015).

Pesaresi M, Ehrilch D, Florczyk AJ, Freire S, Julea A, Kemper T, Soille P, Syrris V (2015) GHS built-up grid, derived from Landsat, multitemporal (1975, 1990, 2000, 2014). In: Eur. Comm. Jt. Res. Cent. (JRC), [Dataset]. http://data.europa.eu/89h/jrc-ghsl-ghs_built_ldsmt_globe_r2015b. Accessed 24 Apr 2019

This dataset can be used to increase the resolution of the exposure models released herein with the open source spatial disaggregation tool that the EFEHR risk team has developed together with the GEM Foundation, available here: https://github.com/GEMScienceTools/spatial-disaggregation. Users of that tool should replace the downloaded WorldPop .tif file with this file, ensuring the same name of the file is used.
