The census data for Romania was provided by Dragos Toma-Danila (toma_drag@yahoo.com) 'data_Romania_RES_census-buildings_original.xlsx'. 
This data has subsequently been post-processed (using the data_Romania_RES_census-buildings_mapping.xlsx' file) to 
simplify the data and reduce the total number of typologies (leading to the final file: 'data_Romania_RES_census-buildings.xlsx'). 
Further improvement of this model with local Romanian experts is expected in 2021.
